# Anti-Spin Logic Explanation

## The Problem We Solved

**Original Issue:**
When the robot detected "no right wall", it would turn right for 300ms. After the turn completed, if it still didn't see a right wall (very likely in open spaces), it would immediately turn right again, creating an **infinite spin**.

## The Solution

### Post-Turn Validation
After **every** turn (right, left, or front), the robot now:

1. **Pauses** briefly (100ms)
2. **Reads sensors** to get current state
3. **Checks conditions** before moving forward:
   - Is the front clear?
   - Did the opposite wall appear?
4. **Decides** whether to move forward or stop

### Specific Rules

#### After RIGHT Turn
```cpp
- Front must be clear (rawF >= FRONT_THRESHOLD)
- LEFT wall must be detected (rawL < SIDE_WALL_THRESHOLD)
- If BOTH conditions met → Move forward 400ms
- If ANY condition fails → STOP, don't move
```

**Why?** If we turned right looking for a right wall, we should now have a left wall. If we don't, we're probably in open space and shouldn't keep moving.

#### After LEFT Turn
```cpp
- Front must be clear (rawF >= FRONT_THRESHOLD)
- RIGHT wall must be detected (rawR < SIDE_WALL_THRESHOLD)
- If BOTH conditions met → Move forward 400ms
- If ANY condition fails → STOP, don't move
```

**Why?** If we turned left looking for a left wall, we should now have a right wall. If we don't, we're probably in open space and shouldn't keep moving.

#### After FRONT Turn (90° wall avoidance)
```cpp
- Front must be clear (rawF >= FRONT_THRESHOLD)
- If condition met → Move forward 400ms
- If condition fails → STOP, don't move
```

**Why?** After turning away from a front wall, we should be able to move forward. If not, we're in a tight corner.

## Example Scenario: Open Intersection

### Without Anti-Spin Logic ❌
```
Step 1: Robot detects no right wall
Step 2: Turn right 300ms
Step 3: Still no right wall → Turn right 300ms
Step 4: Still no right wall → Turn right 300ms
Step 5: Still no right wall → Turn right 300ms
... INFINITE SPIN ...
```

### With Anti-Spin Logic ✅
```
Step 1: Robot detects no right wall
Step 2: Turn right 300ms
Step 3: Check conditions:
        - Front clear? YES
        - Left wall detected? NO (still in open space)
        → STOP, don't move forward
Step 4: Normal loop resumes
Step 5: Check walls again:
        - Still no right wall detected
        - But NOT in TURN state, so just stays stopped
Step 6: Wait for manual intervention or new sensor data
```

## Key Variables

### `currentTurnState`
Current state of the robot:
- `TURN_NONE` - Normal operation
- `TURN_RIGHT` - Actively turning right
- `TURN_LEFT` - Actively turning left
- `TURN_FRONT` - Actively turning from front wall
- `MOVE_FORWARD_AFTER_TURN` - Moving forward after turn validation

### `previousTurnState`
Remembers which turn was just completed so we know which validation rules to apply.

### `turnStartTime` & `turnDuration`
Control how long each state lasts.

## Tuning Parameters

### FORWARD_AFTER_TURN_DURATION (400ms default)
- **Increase** (500-600ms): Robot moves further after turns, discovers more walls
- **Decrease** (200-300ms): Robot moves less, more conservative
- **Trade-off**: Longer = better wall discovery, but may overshoot intersections

### Turn Duration Parameters
- `RIGHT_TURN_DURATION` (300ms): How long to turn right
- `LEFT_TURN_DURATION` (300ms): How long to turn left
- `TURN_DELAY` (400ms): How long for front wall 90° turn

Adjust these based on your robot's turning radius and speed.

## Debug Messages to Watch

When the anti-spin logic is working, you'll see:

```
No right wall - initiating right turn
Turn complete: RIGHT
After turn - L=120 R=8190 F=1500
After RIGHT turn: frontClear=1 hasLeftWall=1
Front is clear - moving forward
Forward movement complete
```

If conditions aren't met:
```
No right wall - initiating right turn
Turn complete: RIGHT
After turn - L=8190 R=8190 F=1500
After RIGHT turn: frontClear=1 hasLeftWall=0
Cannot move forward - front blocked or no wall detected
```

The `8190` values typically indicate "no reading" or "out of range" from the ToF sensors.

## Benefits

1. **Prevents infinite spinning** in open spaces
2. **Validates turns** before committing to forward movement
3. **Safer navigation** - won't blindly move into obstacles
4. **Smarter decision making** - uses sensor feedback
5. **Hysteresis built-in** - natural delay prevents rapid oscillation

## Potential Edge Cases

### Large Open Room
Robot may stop and wait if it can't find walls after turning. This is by design - it won't thrash around.

**Solution:** Manual intervention or timeout logic to explore forward.

### Narrow Passages
If passages are narrower than SIDE_WALL_THRESHOLD, robot may not detect walls properly.

**Solution:** Adjust SIDE_WALL_THRESHOLD for your maze dimensions.

### Sensor Noise
Momentary bad readings could prevent forward movement.

**Solution:** Ensure ALPHA filter is appropriate (0.3 default), or take multiple readings.

## Summary

The anti-spin logic adds **intelligence** to the wall following algorithm by:
- Making the robot **verify** that turns were productive
- Requiring **evidence** (opposite wall detected) before continuing
- Preventing **wasteful** infinite spinning behavior
- Creating **predictable** and **debuggable** behavior

This turns a simple reactive algorithm into a more robust navigation system!
